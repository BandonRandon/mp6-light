This is a plugin lightens the mood of the WordPress Admin for WordPress 3.6+ (formerly known as MP6).


== Description ==

As of version 1.1 this plugin has been completely rewritten and tested with WordPress 4.9. It now uses the `wp_admin_css_color` function.
The plugin no longer requires or checks for <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/mp6/">MP6 </a>. 

Large portions of this rewrite uses code blatantly copied from <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-color-schemes/">Admin Color Schemes</a> by
Kate Whitley, Dave Whitley, Mel Choyce, Kelly Dwan, and the WordPress core team.

Please get involved with the development on github!
